This repo houses small COBOL applications that can be used to learn COBOL if you don't already know it, or learn new features that you haven't seen before if you do.

# json-parse
This simple COBOL application demonstrates how to parse JSON using IBM Enterprise COBOL.  It is written to work in a standalone fashion so it can run without any input files.  The JSON string is declared in memory, as are the resuts from the parse, and everything is printed out for clarity.

# my-first-program
This application shows how well COBOL works with data.  It reads lists from three input files, merges them all together, and sorts them.  The application then writes the sorted list to an output file.  All this in just a few COBOL statements.
